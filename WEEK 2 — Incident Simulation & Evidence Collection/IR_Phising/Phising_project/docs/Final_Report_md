**Project:** Phishing Simulation — GoPhish + MailHog  
**Date collected:** 2025-10-28

---

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Type:** Phishing simulation (credential harvesting)
- **Tools used:** GoPhish (phishing engine), MailHog (SMTP sink), VM: Kali (attacker), Windows (target)
- **Objective:** Simulate phishing, collect evidence, test incident response procedures and user awareness.

---

## 2. Timeline (key timestamps)
- MailHog started: PUT_TIMESTAMP_MAILHOG
- GoPhish admin started: PUT_TIMESTAMP_GOPHISH
- Campaign launched: PUT_TIMESTAMP_LAUNCH
- Emails delivered: PUT_TIMESTAMP_DELIVERED
- Link clicks / credential submissions: PUT_TIMESTAMP_CLICKS
 
 ---

## 3. Evidence collected (paths)
- MailHog .eml files: `~/ir_project/evidence/mailhog_eml/`
- Campaign results CSV: `~/ir_project/evidence/lab_results_all.csv`
- PCAP (if present): `~/ir_project/evidence/*.pcap`
- GoPhish logs: `~/ir_project/gophish_logs/gophish.log`
- Hashes: `~/ir_project/evidence/hashes.txt`

---

## 4. Technical analysis & root cause
- **Attack flow:** Email → Click → Landing page → Credentials submitted.
- **Artifacts observed:** Raw `.eml` files (MailHog), `results` table exported from GoPhish (CSV), any network PCAPs showing HTTP(S) requests to landing page.
- **Root cause:** User interaction with a crafted email (phishing) and lack of detection/blocking for the simulated template. Recommend follow-up on user awareness and email protections.

---

## 5. Containment, eradication & recovery
- **Containment:** Disabled the campaign in GoPhish; removed landing page and phishing content.
- **Eradication:** Stopped GoPhish and MailHog services on test network; removed test accounts from groups.
- **Recovery:** Reset any test credentials that were captured. If this were production, force password reset and investigate lateral movement.

---

## 6. Lessons learned & recommendations
- Regular phishing awareness training and simulated campaigns.
- Implement/validate SPF, DKIM, DMARC for mail domains.
- Centralize logging and increase retention for forensic readiness.
- Harden web servers and use HTTPS with valid certs for external-facing assets.
- Keep a playbook with exact steps to disable campaigns and invalidate links.
